## Voxel Terrain Generator

The Voxel Terrain Generator is a project developed in JavaScript to procedurally generate 3D terrains based on 2D height map images. 

### Features

- Terrain generation: The project utilizes a algorithm that cast rays from the player view on the 2D map, and pixel by pixel generate a 3D terrain based on the heights of each pixel of the map
- Interactive visualization: The generated terrains can be viewed in real-time in a three-dimensional environment, allowing user exploration and interaction.

### Future Features
- Parameter control: A seccion where the user can create his own map and generate in real-time
 
### How to Use
To experience the terrain generator, simply access the project's web page: http://projectsio.000.pe/Projects/Voxel/pagina.html?

### Technologies Used
- JavaScript: The primary programming language for the terrain generator logic.
- HTML/CSS: Utilized for creating the user interface and making the project available as a web application.
